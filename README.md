## Introduction

The MyMSC corpus provides valuable resources for exploring sentiment in Malay-language videos on political and social topics. The collection includes 53 opinion-based videos, divided into 1,208 segments. However, due to copyright restrictions, only 51 videos containing 1,118 segments are provided here for public access.

Each video segment was manually transcribed to capture spoken content, with precise timestamps noted for each utterance. Both MP3 and WAV formats are included for each audio segment.

Annotations are provided at two levels: multimodal and text. This corpus is intended to support advancements in both textual sentiment analysis (SA) and multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA).
