Serena Roseaini Taylor, Fariza Fauzi 

# Introduction:

The MyMSC corpus is made public for research purposes.
MyMSC is a collection of 53 opinionated videos in Malay language, with 1208 segments. The videos were from political and social domain.
The video clips were manually transcribed to extract spoken words. Each utterance was saved with its time frame.
Audio segments have been extracted on both formats, MP3 and .WAV.

Annotation is performed at two levels, multimodal level and text level. It is hoped that the corpus will benefit research in textual sentiment analysis(SA)
and multimodal sentiment analysis(MSA).
