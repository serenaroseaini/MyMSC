MyMSC stands for Malay Multimodal Sentiment Corpus

MyMSC corpus was developed by:
Serena Roseaini Taylor, Wan Fariza binti Fauzi 

Introduction:

The MyMSC corpus is made public for research purpose.
MyMSC contained 53 videos (MP4, 30fps) in Malay language, with 1208 segments.
The segmentations were done using ELAN 6.2 and manually transcribed via the same tool to extract spoken words. Each utterances were saved with its time-frame.
Audio segments have been extracted on both formats, MP3 and .WAV.

Annotation is performed at two levels, multimodal level and text level. It is hope that the corpus can benefit SA in text analysis and Multimodal analysis.
